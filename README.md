# word2vec_vector-translation
Inspired in Mikolov's et al paper "Exploiting Similarities among Languages for Machine Translation", implements an algorithm for translation vectors between two spaces corresponding to two different languages. The code is in java and uses deeplearning4j. I decided to write this implementation since all other related implementations were written in Python and I needed it in Java. Hopefully it will be useful for other people in a similar situation.
